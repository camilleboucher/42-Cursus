# Camille Boucher's 42 school curriculum

## Description
In this repository, you will find all the projects primarily completed in C and C++ as part of the educational curriculum of 42 school concerning the original common core curriculum (pre-2026).

Most projects at 42 require working with the fewest possible libraries to minimize abstractions. By reinventing the wheel, we can better understand complex and fundamental concepts that are hidden behind pre-built components.

The projects are organized in concentric circles. The further you progress into the circles, the greater the difficulty and the more advanced the concepts required.

### Libft (The Core)

This first project is the spiritual successor to the famous C piscine at 42. We must recreate parts of the C standard library (glibc). We gain an initial understanding of UNIX/POSIX system calls, memory management, and fundamental basic concepts in C programming.
