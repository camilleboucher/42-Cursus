# Camille Boucher's 42 school curriculum

## Description
In this repository, you will find all the projects primarily completed in C and C++ as part of the educational curriculum of 42 school concerning the original common core curriculum (pre-2026).

Most projects at 42 require working with the fewest possible libraries to minimize abstractions. By reinventing the wheel, we can better understand complex and fundamental concepts that are hidden behind pre-built components.

The projects are organized in concentric circles called Milestone. The further you progress into the milestones, the greater the difficulty and the more advanced the concepts required.

## Libft (The Core)

This first project is the spiritual successor to the famous C piscine at 42. We must recreate parts of the C standard library (`glibc`). We gain an initial understanding of UNIX/POSIX system calls, memory management, and fundamental basic concepts in C programming.

## Milestone 1

### ft_printf

In this project, we have to recreate the essential parts of the `printf` function. This will allow us to display customized strings, which will be very useful throughout the common core. Variadic functions and va macros will be among the new concepts covered.

### Get Next Line

This project is already a greater obstacle to overcome. Here, we learn to use files through system calls using file descriptors (POSIX API). The difficulty stemmed from the limited number of lines and functions imposed by 42. Debugging was laborious but allowed us to understand certain dynamic memory allocation errors, such as use after free. We also learn about using static variables.

### Born2beRoot

In this project, we need to create a Linux server in the form of a virtual machine. This is an opportunity for me to validate skills I already possess out of passion after more than 20 years of using Linux. We will set up an SSH server, a web server, and system administration skills.

## Milestone 2

### Push_swap

Here we have to sort a stack of numbers with the help of another stack with the least amount of moves. This project is quite complex because it requires many functions and an efficient algorithm. I chose to use a doubly linked list, which allowed me to understand this new concept better and to gain a clearer grasp of linked lists, which I thought I already understood. It was also a great project for me to better assimilate pointers and structures (struct).
